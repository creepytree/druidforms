# <App> — agent reference

<!--
Template for a consumer app of the druids design framework. Copy this file to the
consumer app's repo root as AGENTS.md, replace <App>/<app>, and fill the Layout
section with the app's own files. The Startup + "Do always" sections are generic —
keep them as-is so every consumer app follows the same rules.
-->

<App> is a **consumer of the `druids` design framework** (pip name `druidforms`,
import name `druids`). It is pure Python: FastAPI + Jinja. It ships **no JS build
step** — all design, theming, the app shell, login/session and every `<druid-*>`
element come from the installed `druids` package.

## On resuming edits

1. **Create a venv** and activate it: `python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate`.
2. **Update the framework** into it from its git URL: `pip install "druidforms @ git+<framework-repo-url>"`
3. **Study the CHANGELOG.md** Compare local version with latest pull and check if the project needs patches on the new version or would gain quality, simplification or a reduction in line-count by patching.
4. **Add bugs, gaps, wanted patches to GAPS.md** This gets consumed by the Agent processing the framework. Overwrite with fresh content on a new edit roundtrip if the file notes a resolved state.

## Startup new project

**On the first turn, before writing any UI, install the framework and study it:**

1. **Create a venv** and activate it: `python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate`.
2. **Install the framework** into the venv `pip install "druidforms @ git+<framework-repo-url>"`
3. **Study the framework** in the venv `<site-packages>/druids/AGENTS.md` — the API
   contract (every `<druid-*>` component, `df-*` class, design token and the
   `window.druids` JS API). Build UI only from what it documents.
4. Write AGENTS.consumer.md in the workspace root of the consumer
5. Write README.consumer.md for the consumer, @placeholder@ define allowed changes, keep it strict on this

## Do always

> **Build on the framework, never reinvent it.** Before adding markup, CSS or JS, check
> whether druids already provides it: a `<druid-*>` component, a `df-*` class, a design
> token (`--accent`, `--border`, `--bg-raised`, `--radius`, …) or `druids.toast()` /
> `druids.applyAccent()`. App CSS must theme with those tokens, not hardcoded colors,
> and must not re-implement a component the framework already ships.
>
> **Keep this app matching the framework's current API.** The catalog above is the
> source of truth. If a druids component, attribute, event or class was renamed or
> removed upstream, update this app's templates/CSS/JS to match in the same change.
>
> **Missing or wrong in the design system → fix it upstream, not here.** If a UI need
> isn't met, add or change the component in the `druids` framework repo (rebuild its
> bundle there) rather than growing a local one-off. Only genuinely app-specific UI
> lives in this app.

## Layout

<!-- Fill this in per app. Point at the Druids(...) instance, the routes/templates,
     and where app-specific (non-framework) CSS/JS lives. Example: -->

- `<app>/shell.py` — the single `Druids(...)` instance (brand, version, login,
  `templates_dir`); `<app>/app.py` calls `druids.install(app)`.
- `<app>/routes.py` — pages render via `druids.templates`.
- `<app>/templates/*.jinja2` — extend `druids/base.jinja2`; fill the `styles`, `tabs`,
  `actions`, `content`, `scripts` blocks with `<druid-*>` tags.
- `<app>/static/{css,js}/` — only app-specific UI. Framework CSS is prefixed `df-`;
  keep app class names distinct and token-driven.
